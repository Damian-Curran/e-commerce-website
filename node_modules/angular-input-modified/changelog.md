### Backward-incompatible changes

The following public-properties of the form controller are no longer considered public,
you should not relay on them, cause their behavior can change in the future:

- `ngForm.modifiedCount` - can show a bigger number now, cause it indicates all modified input elements (including all radio buttons)
- `ngForm.modifiedModels` - now contains list of references to the modified models instead of just model names

If you still need this functionality - please [create an issue][new-issue] to discuss this.

Also, form initialization strategy has changed - please see the
[Form initialization][readme-form-init]
section of the [README][readme].
